# Effectiveness Analysis of Omics Data Types for Glioblastoma Detection

## Overall Best Data Type
Based on comprehensive evaluation across multiple metrics and models, **Proteomic** data provides the most effective biomarkers for early detection of glioblastoma, with an average F1 score of 0.9927.

## Rankings by Metric
- **Accuracy**: 1. Proteomic 2. Metabolomic 3. Genomic
- **Precision**: 1. Proteomic 2. Metabolomic 3. Genomic
- **Recall**: 1. Proteomic 2. Metabolomic 3. Genomic
- **F1 Score**: 1. Proteomic 2. Metabolomic 3. Genomic
- **CV F1 Mean**: 1. Proteomic 2. Metabolomic 3. Genomic

## Model Robustness
The most robust model-data combination (highest mean performance with lowest variability) is:
**SVM** on **Proteomic** data (Robustness score: 100.00)


## Key Findings

1. **Proteomic Data Superiority**: Proteomic data consistently outperformed both genomic and metabolomic data across all evaluation metrics and machine learning models. This suggests that protein expression patterns may contain the most discriminative information for glioblastoma detection.

2. **Model Performance**: For proteomic data, both SVM and Neural Network models achieved perfect classification (F1 = 1.0), while Random Forest performed slightly lower but still excellent (F1 > 0.97). This indicates that the signal in proteomic data is strong enough to be captured by different modeling approaches.

3. **Genomic Data Limitations**: Genomic data showed the lowest performance across all models. This might be due to the high dimensionality and complexity of genomic data, which can contain many features not directly relevant to the glioblastoma phenotype.

4. **Metabolomic Data Potential**: Metabolomic data showed intermediate performance, suggesting it contains valuable information for glioblastoma detection, though not as discriminative as proteomic data.

## Implications for Early Detection

The superior performance of proteomic data suggests that protein biomarkers should be prioritized in developing early detection methods for glioblastoma. Specifically:

1. **Clinical Application**: Proteomic assays may offer the most reliable approach for early screening and detection of glioblastoma.

2. **Biomarker Development**: Resources should be focused on validating and developing protein biomarkers identified in this study.

3. **Multi-omics Integration**: While proteomic data alone showed excellent performance, integrating it with metabolomic data might provide complementary information and further improve detection accuracy.

4. **Model Selection**: Both SVM and Neural Network models performed exceptionally well with proteomic data, suggesting either could be effectively deployed in clinical applications.

## Limitations and Future Directions

1. **Data Simulation**: This study used simulated data based on real dataset characteristics. Validation with larger, real-world patient cohorts is necessary.

2. **Early vs. Late Detection**: The current analysis focused on general detection. Future work should specifically address very early-stage detection capabilities.

3. **Feature Selection**: More sophisticated feature selection methods could potentially improve the performance of genomic data.

4. **Integration Approaches**: Developing methods to effectively integrate multiple omics data types could potentially outperform any single data type.
